        <div class="content summary">Harry Potter is about to start his second year at Hogwarts. Harry expects it to be a normal year after his experiences the term before but 
            a secret chamber opens, muggle-born students are attacked and Harry must put his life in danger once more.
            The three main characters in the story are Harry Potter – a young wizard who finds out he can speak Parselmouth (talk to snakes) and is mistaken for the heir of Slytherin; 
            Ron Weasley – Harry’s best friend who steals his Father’s flying car to fly himself and Harry to Hogwarts; and Hermione Granger – Harry’s other best friend who is the smartest 
            student in their year at school but who is petrified when the attacks start. The new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher is Gilderoy Lockhart who is a self-obsessed lunatic of a teacher.

        <div class="content summary">The famous wizard, Harry Potter, is back for another year at Hogwarts, School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
            Harry is delighted when he gets on the Hogwarts Express for the second time, as the summer has been very unenjoyable due to the Dursleys being the only relatives of his left.
            When Harry sees the school after what seems like ages, he sees hooded figures standing outside. Dementors – they guard Azkaban, the most feared wizard prison, and suck all of the happiness out of you.
            Harry finds out why the Dementors are guarding Hogwarts. They are guarding it because they don't want Sirius Black (a prisoner who escaped Azkaban) to break into Hogwarts.
            When Harry finds out that Sirius was his parents secret-keeper, he thinks that Sirius is helping the wizard that tried to kill Harry. Voldemort.
            Whose side does Harry turn to when he finds out the truth, and finds out who Sirius really is?

        <div class="content summary">Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, 
            in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') Death Eaters are 
            gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again. In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts, 
            the competitors are selected by the Goblet of Fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter. 
            Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Triwizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort's rebirth be too much for the young hero?
